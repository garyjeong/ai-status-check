      "taskTitle": "Setup FastAPI Project Structure",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the FastAPI project setup task into subtasks covering: 1) Environment setup with Python and dependencies, 2) Project structure creation with all required folders and files, 3) Basic FastAPI app configuration with initial routes, and 4) Docker configuration for development environment.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves standard project setup procedures with well-defined steps. The complexity is moderate as it requires setting up multiple directories, configuration files, and dependencies, but follows common patterns. The Docker setup adds some complexity but the overall task is well-structured."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Data Models",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the data models implementation task into subtasks covering: 1) Core Pydantic model creation for ComponentStatus, IncidentInfo, and ServiceStatus, 2) Status type enums and validation logic, and 3) Serialization/deserialization methods with comprehensive tests.",
      "reasoning": "This task is relatively straightforward as it involves creating Pydantic models with clear specifications already provided. The complexity is low to moderate since the models are well-defined, though proper validation and serialization will require some attention to detail."

      "taskTitle": "Implement OpenAI Status API Integration",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the OpenAI Status API integration task into subtasks covering: 1) Basic API client implementation with aiohttp, 2) Response parsing and mapping to ServiceStatus model, 3) Error handling and retry logic with exponential backoff, and 4) Caching implementation to prevent excessive API calls.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves external API integration with several complexities: async HTTP requests, error handling, retry logic, and caching. The parsing logic requires mapping external data to internal models. While the API endpoint is straightforward, the robustness requirements add complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Anthropic Status API Integration",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Anthropic Status API integration task into subtasks covering: 1) Basic API client implementation with aiohttp, 2) Response parsing and mapping to ServiceStatus model, 3) Error handling and retry logic with exponential backoff, and 4) Caching implementation to prevent excessive API calls.",
      "reasoning": "This task is very similar to the OpenAI integration with the same complexity factors: async HTTP requests, error handling, retry logic, and caching. The implementation pattern is nearly identical to task #3, but requires separate attention to Anthropic's specific API response structure."

      "reasoning": "Web scraping is inherently more complex than API integration as it deals with HTML parsing which is more brittle. The task requires understanding the DOM structure, selecting appropriate elements, and handling potential changes in the website structure. Additional complexity comes from error handling and ensuring the scraper is resilient to changes."
    },

      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the scheduler implementation task into subtasks covering: 1) APScheduler setup and configuration, 2) Individual update jobs for each service, 3) Redis cache integration for storing results, 4) Logging and error handling for background tasks, and 5) Application lifecycle management (startup/shutdown).",
      "reasoning": "Background task scheduling adds significant complexity as it involves managing asynchronous processes, handling errors in background tasks, and ensuring proper lifecycle management. The integration with Redis for caching and coordinating with multiple services increases the complexity."

      "reasoning": "WebSocket implementation is one of the more complex tasks as it requires managing persistent connections, handling disconnections gracefully, broadcasting messages efficiently, and integrating with the scheduler. The bidirectional communication and stateful nature of WebSockets add significant complexity."

      "reasoning": "Frontend styling requires attention to detail and testing across different screen sizes. The complexity comes from implementing responsive design, ensuring consistent status color coding, and adding appropriate animations. The task is well-defined but requires careful implementation to ensure a good user experience."

      "reasoning": "Client-side WebSocket implementation is complex due to the need to handle connection states, reconnection logic, and real-time UI updates. The task requires careful error handling, managing the WebSocket lifecycle, and ensuring the UI reflects the current connection state. The complexity is increased by the need to handle different types of messages."
    },

      "taskTitle": "Implement Incident History Display",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the incident history display task into subtasks covering: 1) ServiceStatus model updates to include incidents, 2) API integration modifications to fetch incident data, 3) Frontend template updates for incident display, and 4) JavaScript implementation for real-time incident updates.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires modifications across multiple layers of the application: data models, API integrations, and frontend. The complexity comes from ensuring consistent handling of incident data throughout the stack and implementing appropriate UI components to display the information."
    },

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the uptime statistics display task into subtasks covering: 1) API integration modifications to calculate or fetch uptime data, 2) Frontend template updates for uptime visualization, 3) CSS styling for uptime bars and indicators, and 4) JavaScript implementation for real-time uptime updates.",
      "reasoning": "Similar to the incident history task, this requires changes across multiple layers. The complexity involves calculating or fetching accurate uptime statistics, creating visual representations, and ensuring real-time updates. The task is well-defined but requires coordination across different components."

      "reasoning": "Performance optimization requires a deep understanding of the application's data flow and bottlenecks. The complexity comes from implementing Redis caching correctly, managing cache invalidation, and optimizing both HTTP and WebSocket communications. This task touches multiple components and requires careful testing to ensure performance improvements."

      "reasoning": "Comprehensive error handling and logging is complex as it needs to be implemented consistently across the entire application. The task involves setting up structured logging, creating middleware for request tracking, implementing exception handlers, and designing error pages. The cross-cutting nature of this task increases its complexity."
